            <h1>Why Bikes Are Cool</h1>
                <p>Parking at the bottom is near mile 12 of Palmer Fishhook Road, while the top of the trailhead starts near mile 16 of Palmer Fishhook Road. The objectives of this project are to promote mountain biking by creating a progressive trail that can be enjoyed by riders of all ages and ability level, and to increase the diversity of riding opportunities, demonstrate innovative and sustainable trail building design and techniques, and provide a model for other land managers for similar types of projects. Short and fast, with a few small jumps and some loose rocks to keep you on your toes. At the bottom the trail joins Hide and Seek above a major creek crossing. Counterclockwise the descent is shorter but steeper in spots.</p>
                <p>Continue pedaling up through the dark forest around small bands of shale-laden cliffs. Great trail, with amazing views, but may see a lot of traffic. It is considered the "fast and flowy" section--quite a bit smoother overall than Butcher Ranch with a great downhill pitch. Landings are getting a little rotted but the overall condition is good. The turns are all smooth berms and easy to ride and not wash out.</p>
                <p>Starts off flowy with some good jumps then gets into more technical rock gardens. Built specifically for mountain bikes, a flow trail emphasizes speed and rhythm, featuring berms, rollers, jumps and other features that are designed in a way that uses the riderâ€™s momentum to minimize pedaling and braking (think downhill pump track). Check yourself before you wreck yourself. A trail & parking area reconstruction project completed in July '17. The trail is somewhat wide for singletrack and a bit technical with roots and rocks.</p>

            <h2>Mountain Bikes</h2>
            <p>Two wheel drifting is likely if you have speed but are not riding the top few inches of the berms. Normally most of the hikers don't make it to Otero Upper so that section is a little more clear and you can let it hang out a little more. drop to give you an idea of what you're getting into. Use some caution in the corners here. This area has a high density of trails for all ability levels and serves as the unofficial hub of mountain bike activity in the South Shore.</p>

            <h2>Road Bikes</h2>
            <p>It's fire road the entire way, absolutely zero singletrack. Fast transitions and high berms help with the turns. Be careful of the rock stairs relatively close to the top of this portion; too much speed could doom your descent on these. The end of the jump line trail there is a fairly steep climb to get to the next section. The trail is somewhat wide for singletrack and a bit technical with roots and rocks.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Bikes</h2>
            <p>It is considered the "fast and flowy" section--quite a bit smoother overall than Butcher Ranch with a great downhill pitch. The trails all run parallel to the Fountain Place paved road so they can be shuttled by car. A long, long, did I mention long? Fire road that circles Mauna Kea. You now have to ride down an asphalt trail and cut off onto a gravel trail before getting back to the old single track. Technical features are speed and lots of loose rock in between sections of high speed red clay.</p>

            <p>Trail full of berms and fun features! It is steep. High elevation trails are clear May-October, bring plenty of water. This is optional, but recommended way to test how prepared you are for the trail ahead. Lots of branches.</p>
